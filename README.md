# milestone-projects
A repository to host the code for the milestone projects of each student during their learning in the Mobile Academy

## Where do I add my project ?

- Clone the repository and use the `master` branch itself
- Look for the relevant folder (fragments, layout, etc...)
- Under this folder, create a new one with your name
- Add your source code under the newly-created folder
- At the end, the project structure should look like this:
    - :file_folder: fragments/
        - :file_folder: kherin/
            - :file_folder: `your source code`
